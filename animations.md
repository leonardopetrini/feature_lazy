## Compressing Invariant Manifolds in Neural Nets

**Reference:** [article][1]

### *The Stripe Model*

We consider a binary classification task where the label function 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y(\vec x)">
depends only on one direction in the data space, namely 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y( \vec x)=y(x_\parallel)">.
Layers of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y=+1"> and 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y=-1">
regions alternate along the direction <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x_\parallel">
, separated by parallel planes. The two labels are assumed equiprobable. The points 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vec x"> that constitute the training and test set are drawn from d uncorrelated Gaussian distributions <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{1})">.

We take a fully-connected one hidden neural network of activation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma">,

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(\vec x) = \frac{1}{h} \sum_{n=1}^h \beta_n \: \sigma\left(\frac{\vec \omega_n \cdot   \vec x}{\sqrt{d}} %2B b_n\right)">

and we train the function 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F(\vec x) = \alpha \left(f(\vec x) - f_0(\vec x)\right)">
with a discrete approximation of Gradient Flow

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\dot{W} = -\partial_W \frac{1}{p}\sum_\mu l\left(y^\mu F(\vec x^\mu)\right)">,

where the trained parameters are
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=W \in \{\vec\omega_n, b_n, \beta_n \}_{n=1}^h">.

Varying the scale 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha">
drives the network dynamics from the *feature regime* (small 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha">
) to the *lazy regime* (large 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha">
).

In the following animation we show the amplification effect taking place during the evolution of the vectors 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_n \vec \omega_n">
during training in the *feature regime*

</p>

The animation is consistent with the fact that the amplification factor
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Lambda = \sqrt{\frac{\langle \omega_\parallel^2\rangle_h}{\langle\bar\omega_\bot^2\rangle_h}}">
diverges. 

*Note*: considering weights magnitude exploses during learning, vectors length is divided by 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\max(|\beta|\: ||\vec \omega||)">
in order to make them fit in the frame. Relative norms and orientations are the quantities of interest.

Considering we choose <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma(\cdot) = ReLU(\cdot)">,
we can plot the point in space, nearest to the origin, for which the ReLU argument is zero. For each neuron, this is given by 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vec z = - \sqrt{d}b \frac{\omega}{||\omega||^2}">.

In the following we plot the evolution during learning of
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vec z">
for active neurons (by active we mean that the corresponding output weight 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_n">
is non-negligible). Points are colored depending on 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=sign(b_n)">
which says if the ReLU function is oriented towards the origin or away from it
.

</p>

We can distinguish here the three temporal regimes described in the paper:

1. *Compressing Regime*: Before <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t^*">  , all neuron vectors   <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vec z">  converge towards a finite number of fixed points. All fixed points are located on the informative subspace, in accordance with our prediction for the large p limit.
1. *Fitting regime*: After <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t^*">, a finite fraction of the training points escape the loss function and the dynamics exit the ODE prediction: fixed points start moving.
1. *Over-fitting regime*: When the number of points still contributing to the loss function gets of order one, learning focuses on these points and this can result in overfitting. 
  

### *The Cylinder Model*

We consider here an extension of the stripe model where the labelling function 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y( \vec x)">
depends on a subset of coordinates 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vec x_\parallel">
of dimension 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_\parallel < d">.
Specifically, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y( \vec x) = y(||\vec x_\parallel||)">.

We train a fully connected architecture on this dataset, as described in the previous section. We choose 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d = 3"> and
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_\parallel = 2">.

The following animation shows the weight evolution during learning for two different sections of the 3d space:

<p align="center">
  <img width="700" height="350" src="https://github.com/leonardopetrini/feature_lazy/blob/msml20/cylinder_feature.gif">
</p>

Similarly to what is observed in the Stripe Model, we see an amplification of the weigths taking place in the 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\vec x_\parallel">
directions.
